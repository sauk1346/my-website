# Module 01: Rounded and Unrounded Vowels

## What is Vowel Rounding?

Vowel rounding refers to the shape your lips make when producing vowel sounds. It's one of the key articulatory features that distinguishes different vowels from each other.

- **Rounded Vowels:** Your lips are pursed or formed into a circular shape, creating a smaller opening
- **Unrounded Vowels:** Your lips are spread or neutral, creating a larger, more open shape
