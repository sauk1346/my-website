# Module 02: Front Vowels

Front vowels are vowel sounds produced with the highest point of the tongue positioned toward the front of the mouth. The tongue body is advanced forward in the oral cavity, creating a specific acoustic resonance that characterizes these sounds.

## Articulatory Description

**Tongue Position:** The front part of the tongue is raised toward the hard palate
**Tongue Root:** Advanced forward
**Jaw Position:** Typically more open for low front vowels, more closed for high front vowels

## The Front Vowel Series in English

### High Front Vowels:
- **/i/** as in "beet" [bit] - tense, high front
- **/ɪ/** as in "bit" [bɪt] - lax, high front

### Mid Front Vowels:
- **/e/** as in "bait" [bet] - tense, mid front
- **/ɛ/** as in "bet" [bɛt] - lax, mid front

### Low Front Vowels:
- **/æ/** as in "bat" [bæt] - low front
- **/a/** as in "father" [fɑðər] - low central/front (varies by dialect)

## The Vowel Quadrilateral

Front vowels occupy the left side of the traditional vowel chart:

High:    i ——————————————— u
         |                 |
         ɪ                 ʊ
Mid:     |                 |
         e                 o
         |                 |
         ɛ                 ɔ
Low:     |                 |
         æ ——————————————— ɑ
       Front              Back
```

## Tense and Lax Vowels
The tense/lax distinction is a fundamental classification in English vowel phonology based on articulatory effort, acoustic properties, and phonological behavior.

- **Tense Vowels:** Produced with greater muscular effort, more peripheral tongue positions, longer duration, and can occur in open syllables
- **Lax Vowels:** Produced with less muscular effort, more centralized tongue positions, shorter duration, and typically restricted to closed syllables

### High Vowels:
- **Tense:** /i/ as in "beet" [bit] → **Lax:** /ɪ/ as in "bit" [bɪt]
- **Tense:** /u/ as in "boot" [but] → **Lax:** /ʊ/ as in "book" [bʊk]

### Mid Vowels:
- **Tense:** /e/ as in "bait" [bet] → **Lax:** /ɛ/ as in "bet" [bɛt]
- **Tense:** /o/ as in "boat" [bot] → **Lax:** /ɔ/ as in "bought" [bɔt]

### Low Vowels:
- **Lax only:** /æ/ as in "bat" [bæt]
- **Lax only:** /ɑ/ as in "bot" [bɑt] (in most American dialects)
