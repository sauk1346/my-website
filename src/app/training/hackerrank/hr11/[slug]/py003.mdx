# Arithmetic Operators

## Task

The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, $a$ and $b$. 

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
```

Add code to print three lines where

1. The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
2. The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
3. The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

### Input Format
The first line contains the first integer, $a$. The second line contains the second integer, $b$.

### Output Format
Print the three lines as explained above.

### Constraints
- $1 \le a \le 10^{10}$
- $1 \le b \le 10^{10}$


### Example 
> **Input**
> 3
> 2

> **Output**
> 5
> 1
> 6
