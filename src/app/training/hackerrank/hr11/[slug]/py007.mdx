# Print Function

The included code stub will read an integer $n$, from STDIN.

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
``` 

Without using any string methods, try to print the following: $123...n$

Note that $...$ represents the consecutive values in between.

## Example

> **Input**
> 5

> **Output**
> 12345
