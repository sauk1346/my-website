# Sort Colors

Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them **in-place** so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers `0`, `1` and `2` to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
> Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
> Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

**Example 2:**
> Input: nums = [2,0,1]
> Output: [0,1,2]

```python
class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        
        RED = 0
        WHITE = 1
        BLUE = 2
        
        mid = 0
        low = 0
        high = len(nums) - 1
        
        while mid <= high:
            if nums[mid] == RED:
                nums[low], nums[mid] = nums[mid], nums[low]
                low += 1
                mid += 1
            elif nums[mid] == BLUE:
                nums[mid], nums[high] = nums[high], nums[mid]
                high -= 1
            else:
                mid += 1
```
