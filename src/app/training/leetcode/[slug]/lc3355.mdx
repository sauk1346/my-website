# Zero Array Transformation I

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and a 2D array  `queries`, where $queries[i] = [l_i, r_i]$

For each `querires[i]` :

- Select a subset of indices within the range $[l_i, r_i]$ in `nums`
- Decrement the values at the selected indices by 1

A **Zero Array** is an array where all elements are equal to 0.

Return `true` if it is *possible* to transform `nums` into **Zero Array** after processing all the queries sequentially, otherwise return `false`

## Examples

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** nums = [1,0,1], queries = [[0,2]]
> **Output:** true
```markdown
Explanation:
    For i = 0:
        Select the subset of indices as [0, 2] and decrement the values at these indices by 1.
        The array will become [0, 0, 0], which is a Zero Array.
```

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** nums = [4,3,2,1], queries = [[1,3],[0,2]]
> **Output:** false

```markdown
Explanation:
    For i = 0:
        Select the subset of indices as [1, 2, 3] and decrement the values at these indices by 1.
        The array will become [4, 2, 1, 0].
    For i = 1:
        Select the subset of indices as [0, 1, 2] and decrement the values at these indices by 1.
        The array will become [3, 1, 0, 0], which is not a Zero Array.

        current = 0
        for i in range(n):
            current += diff[i]
            if current < nums[i]:
