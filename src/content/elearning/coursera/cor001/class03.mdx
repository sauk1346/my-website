## 1. Machine learning paradigms

    headers={["Paradigm", "Description"]}
    rows={[
        [
            "**Supervised learning**",
            "trains models on labeled data"
        ],
        [
            "**Unsupervised learning**",
            "trains models without labels"
        ],
        [
            "**Semi-supervised learning**",
            "trains models with relative small subsets of data"
        ],
        [
            "**Reinforcement learning**",
            "simulates an artificially intelligent agent interacting with its environment and learns how to make decisions based on feedback from its environment"
        ],
    ]}

## 2. Machine learning techniques
Selecting a machine learning technique depends on several factors, such as the problem you're trying to solve, the type of data you have, the available resources, and the desired outcome.

<SmartTable
    tableLayout="auto"
    headers={["technique", "Description"]}
    rows={[
        [
            "**Classification**",
            "Predics class or category of a case"
        ],
         [
            "**Regression/estimation**",
            "Predicts continuous values"
        ],
         [
            "**Clustering**",
            "Groups similar data"
        ],
         [
            "**Association**",
            "Finds items or events that co-occur"
        ],
        [
            "**Anomaly detection**",
            "Discovers abnormal and unusual cases"
        ],
        [
            "**Sequence mining**",
            "Predicts next event"
        ],
        [
            "**Dimension reduction**",
            "Reduces size of data"
        ],
        [
            "**Recomendation systems**",
            "Associate people's preferences"
        ],
    ]}
/>

## 3. Classification and regression
To train your machine learning model on supervised data, you can select between the classification or regression technique.

/>

- **Classification:** Categorizes input data into one of several predefined categories or classes, and then makes predictions about the class membership of new observations
- **Regression:** Is different from classification. It does not make predictions about the class membership of new input data. Regression predicts continuous numerical values from input data.

## 4. Clustering
- Clustering is one of many unsupervised machine learning techniques for data modeling
- It's used to group data points or objects that are somehow similar

 ### Example
- In this chart, we use a clustering algorithm to represent data points in green, red, and blue color. 
- The uncategorized data points represented in black color are considered noise.

## 5. Application of machine learning

- Analysis of cell samples: identifying if human cell is benign of malignant
- Netflix and Amazon use ML to generate suggestions
- Banks use ML to approve or deny loans
- Telecommunication companies use demographics data to segment custormers

## 6. Image recognition with machine learning

- **Data:** Images of cats and dogs
- **Before ML:** Create rules to detect the animals
- **With ML:** Build a model to infer the animal type

## 7. Pairing machine learning with human intelligence

- Increasing ML applications
- Humans are still in the mix
- **Example:** If ML algorithm refuses a loan, a banker wants to know why

### Other applications
There are many other applications of machine learning that we see every day.

- Virtual assistants like chatbots logging into our phones using face recognition 
- Playing computer games like chess 

Each of these use different machine learning techniques and algorithms.
