The model lifecycle is iterative, which means that we tend to go back and forth between these processes. 

For example, if you find some problems with your models that are deployed in production, you may need to go back to data collection, or even the problem definition step, and then re-iterate the subsequent processes. 

## 2. ETL

- **Extract, Transform, and Load**
- It's the **data preparation** phase
- The ETL process involves collecting data from various sources, then cleaning, transforming, and storing it into a new single place
