# A day in the life of a ML Engineer

*Let’s go through the Lifecycle of a Machine Learning Model in a project that I am currently working on.* 

- To help increase business revenue, I have been tasked with creating and deploying a model that recommends similar products to what the customer has already bought
- I have worked together with the client to come up with an end-user’s pain point

## 1. End-user's paint point

> As a beauty product customer, I would **like to receive recommendations for other products based on my purchase history** so that I will be able to address my skincare needs and improve the overall health of my skin

## 2. Data collection

I should determine what kind of data the company has and identify the sources it will come from.

- **User data:** demographics, purchase history, etc
- **Product data:** inventory, ingredients, popularity
- **Other data:** saved products, liked products, search history

### Transforming
*I will go ahead and do some major transforming by:*

 - wrangling, aggregating, joining, merging, and mapping the data onto one central source

This reduces the need to deal with multiple databases every time we need to pull data.

## 3. Data Preparation
Most of the time, data from multiple sources will contain errors, different formatting, and missing data.
 
This process overlaps with the Data Collection process as they can be done in tandem.

- Clean data to remove irrelevant data
- Remove extreme values
- Missing values should ve removed or replaced
- Each data column should be in the proper format
- Create new features
    - For example, I may need to calculate the average duration between transactions for each user and find which products they buy the most
    - I may need a feature that identifies what kind of skin issues each product targets and assign them to each user
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Identify how to split up the data into training and test sets

## 4. Model Development
*I will go ahead and build a Machine Learning model.*

### Content-based-filtering
This technique finds the similarity between products, based on product content.

**Example:** someone is using a cleanser with lots of water, it is likely that the user has dry skin and will want a moisturizer that is highly moisturizing as well. 

- One of the steps I might take here is to create a similarity score of the products a user has purchased and rank them to other products.

### Collaborative Filtering

I am creating similarities between two users based on how they view a product.

**Example:** I can create a similarity, based on how two users rate their product. 

- First, I group users into a bucket based on their characteristics. This could be age, region, and skin type, products the users rated, and or purchased. 
- Then, I can take the average ratings for existing members and assume that the new user will be somewhere around the average, and recommend a product based on what others have rated highly.

## 5. Model Evaluation
The initial stages of Model Evaluation will involve me tuning the model and doing some testing on the data set I had kept earlier for testing.

Once I am satisfied with the results, I will further evaluate the model by experimenting with the recommendations on a group of users and asking for their feedback.

## 6. Model Deployment
While this is the last step, I still need to track the deployed model’s performance to make sure it continues to do the job that the business requires.

- Continue to track model performance
- Retrain model based on new information
