# Data Scientist vs AI Engineer

For many years, data science has been called the sexiest job of the 21st century, but in recent years, it seems like there's a new job vying for that title, the AI engineer.

Data scientists have always used AI models to do their analysis. So what's changed? 

At a very high level, think of a **data scientist** as a data storyteller.
- They take massive amounts of messy real world data
- They use mathematical models to translate this data into insights. 

On the other hand, think of an **AI engineer** as an AI system builder.

- They use foundation models to build generative AI systems that help to transform business processes.

## 1. Data Scientist
They have to use what are called machine learning models to make their predictions.

- **Regression models:** Predicts a numeric value such as, a temperature or a revenue.
- **Classification models:** Predicts a categorical value such as a success or a failure.

## 2. AI Engineer

One of the main use cases that AI engineers work on are called **prescriptive use cases**, which are all about choosing the best course of action.

### Prescriptive use cases
- **Decision optimization:** Enables businesses to assess a set of possible actions and then choose the most optimal path based off a set of requirements or standards
- **Recommendation engines:** This can involve suggesting targeted marketing campaigns for a select customer base

### Generative use cases (Generative AI)

- intelligent assistants
- chatbots
